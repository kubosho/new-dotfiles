# Personal Preferences

## Language
- Respond and explain in Japanese
- Write code comments and commit messages in English

## Commit Messages
- Explain "why" (the reason/motivation for the change), not just "what"

## Code Comments
- When user presents multiple approaches and one is chosen, add comments explaining why other options were not selected

## Programming Languages
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust

## Coding Style Priorities
1. Simplicity - Minimal code to achieve the goal
2. Readability - Clear naming and structure
3. Type Safety - Strict type definitions
4. Performance - Efficient execution

## Testing
- Prefer E2E/integration tests over unit tests
- Focus on testing user-facing behavior

## General Guidelines
- Avoid over-engineering
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Delete unused code completely (no backward-compatibility hacks)
